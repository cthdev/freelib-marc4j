# FreeLib-MARC4J [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ksclarke/freelib-marc4j.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ksclarke/freelib-marc4j)

This is a fork of the MARC4J project. It will diverge from the upstream project, but will also attempt to continue to support the public APIs.

For more detailed information about this fork, read its [documentation](http://projects.freelibrary.info/freelib-marc4j/).

### Getting Started

The project page has more detail, but if you'd like to jump right in (and already have [Maven](http://maven.apache.org) installed), clone this project from [its GitHub page](http://github.com/ksclarke/freelib-marc4j):

    git clone http://github.com/ksclarke/freelib-marc4j

change into its project directory:

    cd freelib-marc4j

and type:

    mvn install

This will compile the project and run its tests.  It will install a jar file into your local Maven repository and also leave a copy in the project's target directory (in case you don't care about Maven and just want the jar file artifact).  If you want to recompile, you can run the above command again.  If you want a completely clean build, you can run:

    mvn clean install

This will delete the whole 'target' folder (the product of running a Maven build) and will create a new one.

If you want to create the Javadocs for the project, you can type:

    mvn javadoc:javadoc

and they will be created in `freelib-marc4j/target/site/apidocs`

If you just want to include MARC4J as a dependency in your own Maven-managed project, you can by adding the following to your project's dependencies:

    <dependency>
        <groupId>info.freelibrary</groupId>
        <artifactId>freelib-marc4j</artifactId>
        <version>2.6.12</version>
    </dependency>
